Lua library to help making [Corona](https://coronalabs.com/) games.

Contains common code I found useful and shareable:

- arr - array implementation
- ass - assert library
- bro - broadcast event to subscribers
- cnt - container for countable objects
- lay - layout 2D display objects for UI
- log - logging system with log severity and stack depth indentation
- map - map key to value, which is Lua table
- obj - object inheritance implementation
- pkg - collect mudules into packages to call common functions like wrap and test
- typ - type checking
- vec - 2D vector
- wrp - instrument any function with argument type checkers and logs (and performance meter in future)

* Not developing this project anymore. Switched to other wonderful techs.
