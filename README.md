# luacor
Lua library to help making [Corona](https://coronalabs.com/) games.

Contains common code I found useful and shareable:

  - arr - work with Lua arrays
  - ass - assert library
  - cnt - special container for countable objects
  - env - container for singleton objects, simple depency injection among them
  - evt - emitter/subscriber
  - lay - layout 2D display objects for UI
  - log - logging system with log severity and stack depth indentation
  - map - work with Lua tables
  - obj - inheritance implementation
  - pkg - collect mudules into packages to call common functions like wrap and test
  - typ - type checking
  - vec - 2D vector
  - wrp - instrument any function with argument type checkers and logs (and performance meter in future)
